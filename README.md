# Jarvis 

This is my first public project. I have been working on this locally for ~5 months, and decided to rebuild it and make it better on github. 

## Disclaimer

I have built this on a Linux machine, 
and I am not sure that it will work on Windows.
Microphone and Speaker required.

## Installation

Clone the repo.

cd into the repo.

``` sh
python3 Install.py
```
This will run the setup.

If all goes correctly, Jarvis should boot at start.

Now reboot you system using:

``` sh
init 6
```
